# Material Design New Tab page
This Chrome Extension provides a very simple and fast new tab page, plain vanilla JS and HTML.

Some things aren't working yet (like adding a website, oops) but I'll fix that.

This projects really aims at being **SIMPLE**, here are the only features planned :

- Background that changes automatically depending on the hour
- Favorite websites with custom icon and color
